Maven is based on developing pure Java language-based software. Configuration It uses a Groovy-based Domain-specific language(DSL) for creating project structure. It uses Extensible Markup Language(XML) for creating project structure. Focuses on Developing applications by adding new features to them. Developing applications in a given time limit. Performance It performs better than maven as it optimized for tracking only current running task. It does not create local temporary files during software creation hence uses large time. Java Compilation It avoids compilation. It is necessary to compile. Usability It is a new tool, which requires users to spend a lot of time to get used to it. This tool is a known tool for many users and is easily available. Customization This tool is highly customizable as it supports a variety of IDE\u2019s. This tool serves a limited amount of developers and is not that customizable. Languages supported It supports software development in Java, C, C++, and Groovy.

All of these features provided by <code>Keycloak</code> can easily integrate your application without any coding at all. By delegating authentication of the user to <code>Keycloak</code>, you don\u2019t worry about authentication mechanisms, safely store passwords, etc. You can enable two-factor authentication without having to make changes to the application. This also increases your application security because in this situation your application doesn\u2019t have access to user credentials, it can only know tokens issued by <code>Keycloak</code>.</li> <li>The tables below will show main features of <code>Keycloak</code>.</li> </ul> Keycloak Features Descriptions Multiple Protocols Support As for now Keycloak supports three different protocols, namely - OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0. SSO Keycloak has full support for Single Sign-On and Single Sign-Out. Admin Console Keycloak offers web-based GUI where you can \u201cclick out\u201d all configurations required by your instance to work as you desire. User Identity and Accesses Keycloak can be used as a standalone user identity and access manager by allowing us to create users database with custom roles and groups. This information can be further used to authenticate users within our application and secure parts of it based on pre-defined roles. External Identity Source Sync In case when your client currently has some type of user database, Keycloak allows us to synchronize with such database. By default, it supports\u00a0<code>LDAP</code>\u00a0and\u00a0<code>Active Directory</code>\u00a0but you can create custom extensions for any user database using Keycloak User storage API. Keep in mind that such a solution may not have all data necessary for Keycloak to be fully functional, so remember to check if your desired functionality works. Identity Brokering Keycloak can also work as a proxy between your users and some external identity provider or providers. Their list can be edited from Keycloak Admin Panel. Social Identity Providers Additionally, Keycloak allows us to use Social Identity Providers. It has built-in support Google, Twitter, Facebook, Stack Overflow but, in the end, you have to configure all of them manually from admin panel. The full list of supported social identity providers and their configuration manual can be found in Keycloak documentation. Pages Customization Keycloak lets you customize all pages displayed by it to your users. Those pages are in\u00a0<code>.ftl</code>\u00a0format so you can use classic\u00a0<code>HTML</code>\u00a0 markups and\u00a0<code>CSS</code>\u00a0styles to make the page fit your \u00a0application style and your company brand. You can even put custom\u00a0<code>JS</code>\u00a0scripts as part of pages customization so possibilities are limitless.","tags":["Docker"]},{"location":"Docker/Docker%20With%20Keycloak/#create_keycloak_server_with_docker","title":"Create Keycloak Server With Docker","text":"<ul> <li>Let's create a file name <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, then add scripts as below:</li> </ul> docker-compose.yml<pre><code>version: '3'\n\nvolumes:\n  postgres_data:\n      driver: local\n\nservices:\n  postgres:\n      #Get lastest postgres docker image from DockerHub\n      image: postgres\n      volumes:\n        - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n      environment:\n        POSTGRES_DB: keycloak\n        #Set username and password for postgres database  \n        POSTGRES_USER: admin\n        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: admin\n  keycloak:\n      #Get keycloak docker image from Red Hat\n      image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:legacy\n      environment:\n        DB_VENDOR: POSTGRES\n        DB_ADDR: postgres\n        DB_DATABASE: keycloak\n        DB_USER: admin\n        DB_SCHEMA: public\n        DB_PASSWORD: admin\n        #Set username and password for default keycloak user\n        KEYCLOAK_USER: admin\n        KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD: admin\n        # Uncomment the line below if you want to specify JDBC parameters.

In this case, it is using the official OpenJDK 8 image with Alpine Linux as the base operating system. This image provides Java 8 runtime environment. <code>WORKDIR /app</code> This sets the working directory inside the container to <code>/app</code>. It's a good practice to use a specific directory for your application. <code>COPY target/json-schema-validator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /app/json-schema-validator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code> This copies the compiled Spring Boot application JAR file from the <code>target</code> directory of the host machine into the <code>/app</code> directory of the container. The source file is <code>json-schema-validator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code> in the <code>target</code> directory, and the destination is <code>/app/json-schema-validator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code> in the container. <code>EXPOSE 8080</code> This declares that the Spring Boot application listens on port 8080 inside the container. It does not actually publish the port to the host machine, but it provides a hint to users of the image about the exposed port. <code>CMD [\"java\", \"-jar\", \"-Dspring.profiles.active=dev\", \"json-schema-validator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\"]</code> This is the command that will be executed when the container starts. It runs the Spring Boot application using the <code>java -jar</code> command. The <code>-Dspring.profiles.active=dev</code> part sets the active Spring profile to <code>dev</code>. The <code>json-schema-validator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code> is the JAR file that will be executed. <ul> <li>You can view more at DockerFile Command Descriptions</li> </ul>","tags":["Docker"]},{"location":"Docker/Docker%20With%20SpringBoot/#build_docker_image_from_dockerfile","title":"Build Docker Image From Dockerfile","text":"<ul> <li>Afer creating a <code>Dockerfile</code>, we will use the command below to build a docker image.</li> </ul> <pre><code>docker build -f &lt;Dockerfile Name&gt; -t &lt;image name:version&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Ex:</p> <pre><code>docker build . -t json-schema-validator:0.0.1\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>The <code>.</code> at the end of the command tells Docker to build the image from the current directory.

If the stream is empty then true is returned and the predicate is not evaluated. <code>boolean anyMatch(Predicate&lt;? super T&gt; predicate)</code> It returns any element of this stream that matches the provided predicate. If the stream is empty then false is returned and the predicate is not evaluated. <code>static &lt;T&gt; Stream.Builder&lt;T&gt; builder()</code> It returns a builder for a Stream. <code>&lt;R,A&gt; R collect(Collector&lt;? super T,A,R&gt; collector)</code> It performs a mutable reduction operation on the elements of this stream using a Collector. A Collector encapsulates the functions used as arguments to collect(Supplier, BiConsumer, BiConsumer), allowing for reuse of collection strategies and composition of collect operations such as multiple-level grouping or partitioning. <code>&lt;R&gt; R collect(Supplier&lt;R&gt; supplier, BiConsumer&lt;R,? super T&gt; accumulator, BiConsumer&lt;R,R&gt; combiner)</code> It performs a mutable reduction operation on the elements of this stream. A mutable reduction is one in which the reduced value is a mutable result container, such as an ArrayList, and elements are incorporated by updating the state of the result rather than by replacing the result. <code>static &lt;T&gt; Stream&lt;T&gt; concat(Stream&lt;? extends T&gt; a, Stream&lt;? extends T&gt; b)</code> It creates a lazily concatenated stream whose elements are all the elements of the first stream followed by all the elements of the second stream. The resulting stream is ordered if both of the input streams are ordered, and parallel if either of the input streams is parallel. When the resulting stream is closed, the close handlers for both input streams are invoked. <code>long count()</code> It returns the count of elements in this stream. This is a special case of a reduction. <code>Stream&lt;T&gt; distinct()</code> It returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements (according to Object.equals(Object)) of this stream. <code>static &lt;T&gt; Stream&lt;T&gt; empty()</code> It returns an empty sequential Stream. <code>Stream&lt;T&gt; filter(Predicate&lt;? super T&gt; predicate)</code> It returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. <code>Optional&lt;T&gt; findAny()</code> It returns an Optional describing some element of the stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty. <code>Optional&lt;T&gt; findFirst()</code> It returns an Optional describing the first element of this stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty. If the stream has no encounter order, then any element may be returned. <code>&lt;R&gt; Stream&lt;R&gt; flatMap(Function&lt;? super T,? extends Stream&lt;? extends R&gt;&gt; mapper)</code> It returns a stream consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element. Each mapped stream is closed after its contents have been placed into this stream. (If a mapped stream is null an empty stream is used, instead.) <code>DoubleStream flatMapToDouble(Function&lt;? super T,? extends DoubleStream&gt; mapper)</code> It returns a DoubleStream consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element. Each mapped stream is closed after its contents have placed been into this stream.

Each mapped stream is closed after its contents have been placed into this stream. (If a mapped stream is null an empty stream is used, instead.) <code>LongStream flatMapToLong(Function&lt;? super T,? extends LongStream&gt; mapper)</code> It returns a LongStream consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element. Each mapped stream is closed after its contents have been placed into this stream. (If a mapped stream is null an empty stream is used, instead.) <code>void forEach(Consumer&lt;? super T&gt; action)</code> It performs an action for each element of this stream. <code>void forEachOrdered(Consumer&lt;? super T&gt; action)</code> It performs an action for each element of this stream, in the encounter order of the stream if the stream has a defined encounter order. <code>static &lt;T&gt; Stream&lt;T&gt; generate(Supplier&lt;T&gt; s)</code> It returns an infinite sequential unordered stream where each element is generated by the provided Supplier. This is suitable for generating constant streams, streams of random elements, etc. <code>static &lt;T&gt; Stream&lt;T&gt; iterate(T seed,UnaryOperator&lt;T&gt; f)</code> It returns an infinite sequential ordered Stream produced by iterative application of a function f to an initial element seed, producing a Stream consisting of seed, f(seed), f(f(seed)), etc. <code>Stream&lt;T&gt; limit(long maxSize)</code> It returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, truncated to be no longer than maxSize in length. <code>&lt;R&gt; Stream&lt;R&gt; map(Function&lt;? super T,? extends R&gt; mapper)</code> It returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. <code>DoubleStream mapToDouble(ToDoubleFunction&lt;? super T&gt; mapper)</code> It returns a DoubleStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. <code>IntStream mapToInt(ToIntFunction&lt;? super T&gt; mapper)</code> It returns an IntStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. <code>LongStream mapToLong(ToLongFunction&lt;? super T&gt; mapper)</code> It returns a LongStream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. <code>Optional&lt;T&gt; max(Comparator&lt;? super T&gt; comparator)</code> It returns the maximum element of this stream according to the provided Comparator. This is a special case of a reduction. <code>Optional&lt;T&gt; min(Comparator&lt;? super T&gt; comparator)</code> It returns the minimum element of this stream according to the provided Comparator. This is a special case of a reduction. <code>boolean noneMatch(Predicate&lt;? super T&gt; predicate)</code> It returns elements of this stream match the provided predicate. If the stream is empty then true is returned and the predicate is not evaluated. <code>@SafeVarargs static &lt;T&gt; Stream&lt;T&gt; of(T... values)</code> It returns a sequential ordered stream whose elements are the specified values. <code>static &lt;T&gt; Stream&lt;T&gt; of(T t)</code> It returns a sequential Stream containing a single element. <code>Stream&lt;T&gt; peek(Consumer&lt;? super T&gt; action)</code> It returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, additionally performing the provided action on each element as elements are consumed from the resulting stream. <code>Optional&lt;T&gt; reduce(BinaryOperator&lt;T&gt; accumulator)</code> It performs a reduction on the elements of this stream, using an associative accumulation function, and returns an Optional describing the reduced value, if any. <code>T reduce(T identity, BinaryOperator&lt;T&gt; accumulator)</code> It performs a reduction on the elements of this stream, using the provided identity value and an associative accumulation function, and returns the reduced value. <code>&lt;U&gt; U reduce(U identity, BiFunction&lt;U,? super T,U&gt; accumulator, BinaryOperator&lt;U&gt; combiner)</code> It performs a reduction on the elements of this stream, using the provided identity, accumulation and combining functions. <code>Stream&lt;T&gt; skip(long n)</code> It returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first n elements of the stream.

Its initial version was released on 18 March 2014. With the Java 8 release, Java provided supports for functional programming, new JavaScript engine, new APIs for date time manipulation, new streaming API, etc.</li> <li>Some of the key features introduced in Java 8 include:</li> </ul> Feature Description Lambda Expressions A new syntax for writing anonymous functions that makes it easier  to write code that processes collections and streams of data. Streams A new set of APIs that make it easier to work with collections and perform bulk  operations on data. Default Methods Default methods A new feature that allows interfaces to have default method  implementations, making it easier to add new methods to existing interfaces without breaking compatibility with existing implementations. Date and time API A new API for working with dates and times that is more flexible and  easier to use than the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes. Nashorn JavaScript engine A new JavaScript engine that allows you to run JavaScript  code directly from within your Java applications. Type annotations A new feature that allows you to annotate your code with additional  information about types, making it easier to catch errors and improve code quality. Optional A new class that provides a way to represent an object that may or may not be present. It is designed to reduce the number of null pointer exceptions in Java code, and to encourage developers to write more robust and safer code. Method references A shorthand syntax for referring to existing methods or constructors. They provide a way to pass behavior around as if it were a value, which can make code more concise and expressive. Method references allow you to create a lambda expression that refers to an existing method or constructor by name. There are four types of method references: static method references, instance method references, constructor references, and arbitrary object instance method references. Interfaces with static methods A new feature that allows interfaces to declare static methods, which are methods that belong to the interface itself and can be called without an instance of the interface. This feature makes it easier to define utility methods that are related to the interface's purpose and can be reused by all implementations of the interface. It also provides a way to organize related utility methods in a single place, rather than scattering them across different classes.","tags":["Java"]},{"location":"Java/Java%208/#see_also","title":"See Also","text":"<ul> <li>Java 8 Interface With Static Method</li> <li>Java 8 Interface With Default Method</li> <li>Java 8 Optional</li> <li>Java 8 Functional Interface</li> <li>Java 8 Lambda Expression</li> <li>Java 8 Stream</li> </ul>","tags":["Java"]},{"location":"Java/Java%208/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>tutorialspoint</li> </ul>","tags":["Java"]},{"location":"Java/Java%20Annotations/","title":"Java Annotations","text":"","tags":["Java"]},{"location":"Java/Java%20Annotations/#definition","title":"Definition","text":"<ul> <li>Annotations, a form of metadata, provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself.

Java platform includes a\u00a0<code>collections framework</code>. A\u00a0<code>collection</code>\u00a0is an object that represents a group of objects (such as the classic\u00a0Vector\u00a0class). A <code>collections framework</code> is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details.</li> <li>Below are the primary advantages of a collections framework</li> </ul> Advantages Details Reduces programming effort by providing data structures and algorithms so you don't have to write them yourself. Increases performance by providing high-performance implementations of data structures and algorithms. Because the various implementations of each interface are interchangeable, programs can be tuned by switching implementations. Provides interoperability between unrelated APIs by establishing a common language to pass collections back and forth. Reduces the effort required to learn APIs by requiring you to learn multiple ad hoc collection APIs. Reduces the effort required to design and implement APIs by not requiring you to produce ad hoc collections APIs. Fosters software reuse by providing a standard interface for collections and algorithms with which to manipulate them. <p>The collections framework consists of components.</p> Components Details Collection interfaces Represent different types of collections, such as sets, lists, and maps. These interfaces form the basis of the framework. General-purpose implementations Primary implementations of the collection interfaces. Legacy implementations The collection classes from earlier releases,\u00a0Vector\u00a0and\u00a0Hashtable, were retrofitted to implement the collection interfaces. Special-purpose implementations Implementations designed for use in special situations. These implementations display nonstandard performance characteristics, usage restrictions, or behavior. Concurrent implementations Implementations designed for highly concurrent use. Wrapper implementations Add functionality, such as synchronization, to other implementations. Convenience implementations High-performance \"mini-implementations\" of the collection interfaces. Abstract implementations Partial implementations of the collection interfaces to facilitate custom implementations. Algorithms Static methods that perform useful functions on collections, such as sorting a list. Infrastructure Interfaces that provide essential support for the collection interfaces. Array Utilities Utility functions for arrays of primitive types and reference objects. Not, strictly speaking, a part of the collections framework, this feature was added to the Java platform at the same time as the collections framework and relies on some of the same infrastructure.","tags":["Java","JavaBasic"]},{"location":"Java/Java%20Collection%20Framework/#java_collection_framework_hierarchy","title":"Java Collection Framework Hierarchy","text":"<ul> <li>The hierarchy of collection framework is showed as below.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The collection interfaces are divided into two groups.

Static fields are shared across all objects, and static methods can be called without creating an object. <code>final</code> For variables, the value cannot be changed once assigned. For methods, they cannot be overridden by subclasses. For classes, they cannot be inherited. <code>abstract</code> For methods, it means the method has no implementation and must be implemented by subclasses. For classes, it means the class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods. <code>synchronized</code> Controls concurrent access by allowing only one thread at a time to execute a method or block, helping prevent race conditions. <code>volatile</code> Ensures that reads and writes of a variable go directly to main memory, guaranteeing visibility of changes across threads but not atomicity. <code>transient</code> Excludes the field from the default serialization process so its value is not saved when the object is serialized.","tags":["Java","JavaBasic"]},{"location":"Java/Java%20Modifiers/#final_keyword_in_java","title":"Final Keyword In Java","text":"<ul> <li>The <code>final</code> keyword in java is used to restrict the user.

Dependency Management Helm supports specifying and managing dependencies between charts, enabling complex application composition. <ul> <li>Here's the workflow for using Helm presented as a table:</li> </ul> Step Description 1. Create or Obtain a Chart You can either create your own Helm charts for your applications or obtain pre-made charts from public or private repositories. Many popular applications and services offer Helm charts. 2. Customize Values Customize the configuration of a Helm chart by providing custom values. These values override the defaults defined in the chart. 3. Install the Chart Use the Helm CLI to install the chart into your Kubernetes cluster. Specify the release name and values file (if needed). Helm will create the necessary Kubernetes resources based on the chart and values. 4. Upgrade and Rollback Helm provides tools to easily upgrade a release to a new version of the chart or roll back to a previous version if issues arise during deployment or updates. 5. Uninstall When you're finished with an application, use Helm to uninstall the release. Helm will remove all associated resources, ensuring a clean removal.","tags":["Kubernetes","Helms"]},{"location":"Kubernetes/Helm/#why_helm","title":"Why Helm?","text":"<ul> <li>In the Minikube Sample Project, we already knew the way to deploy a simple Spring Boot application and MongoDB with Kubernetes.

This allows for easy customization without altering the chart's templates. <ul> <li>In this example, we just focus on creating resource templates and configuration value files because we just to deploy a simple application on multiple environments.</li> </ul>","tags":["Kubernetes","Helms"]},{"location":"Kubernetes/Helm/#creating_templates","title":"Creating Templates","text":"<ul> <li>So let's create yaml templates files in the folder <code>templates</code> as we did in the Minikube Sample Project.</li> </ul>","tags":["Kubernetes","Helms"]},{"location":"Kubernetes/Helm/#configure_templates","title":"Configure Templates","text":"<ul> <li>Let's start with the <code>mongo-config.yaml</code> , normally without using helm we will have the <code>mongo-config.yaml</code> with the content as below.</li> </ul> mongo-config.yaml<pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: mongo-config\ndata:\n  mongo-url: mongo-service\n  mongo-port: \"27017\"\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>We can see that the values of <code>name</code>, <code>mongo-url</code> and <code>mongo-port</code> are hard-coded.

So the spring boot profile will be gotten from  environment variable of Docker Container.

In this case, the selector specifies that the Service should route traffic to Pods with the label \"app\" set to \"spring-boot-app.\" This label corresponds to the labels set on the Pods.</li> <li><code>ports</code>: This section specifies the ports configuration for the Service:<ul> <li><code>- protocol: TCP</code>: This section specifies the protocol to use for the port, which is TCP in this case.</li> <li><code>name: spring-boot-port</code>: It provides a name for the port. This name can be used as an identifier for this port within the Service configuration.</li> <li><code>port: 8080</code>: This line sets the port number on which the Service will listen for incoming network traffic. In this example, it's configured to listen on port 8080.</li> <li><code>targetPort: 8080</code>: This line specifies the target port on the Pods to which incoming traffic will be forwarded. It matches the port number 8080, which is the port that the Spring Boot application inside the Pods is listening on.</li> <li><code>nodePort: 30000</code>: This line sets the NodePort, which is the external port that will be open on each Node in the cluster. In this case, the Service will be accessible externally on NodePort 30000.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Next, we will execute the command below to apply the <code>Service</code> to <code>minikube</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>kubectl apply -n default -f spring-boot-service.yaml\n</code></pre> <p></p> <ul> <li>Okay so, we finished deployments for MongoDB and Spring Boot Service which will connect to MongoDB.

This is achieved by incrementally replacing the current Pods with new ones and usually called <code>Rolling update</code>.</li> <li><code>Rolling Updates</code>: By default, Kubernetes deployments roll-out pod version updates with a rolling update strategy. This strategy aims to prevent application downtime by keeping at least some instances up-and-running at any point in time while performing the updates. Old pods are only shutdown after new pods of the new deployment version have started-up and became ready to handle traffic.</li> <li>Depending on the workload and available compute resources, we can configure how many instances we want to over- or under-provision at any time. For example, given three desired replicas, should we create three new pods immediately and wait for all of them to start up, should we terminate all old pods except one, or do the transition one-by-one.</li> <li>To make <code>Kubernetes</code> knows the pods are ready to to handle traffic or shutdown we have to configure the <code>Readiness Probe</code> and <code>Liveness Probe</code>. Kubernetes will only route the client traffic to the pods with a healthy `Liveness Probe.</li> <li>The pods have to provide a method for <code>Kubernetes</code> then it can check the health status of them.

Mount Options <code>defaults</code> Set of default mount options, which includes: <code>rw</code> (read/write), <code>suid</code>, <code>dev</code>, <code>exec</code>, <code>auto</code> (automatically mount at boot), <code>nouser</code> (only root can mount), <code>async</code>. Dump Field <code>0</code> Indicates whether the filesystem should be backed up using the <code>dump</code> utility. <code>0</code> means it will not be included in backups. Pass Field <code>0</code> Controls the order of filesystem checking by <code>fsck</code> during boot. <code>0</code> means it will not be checked. <code>1</code> means check first (usually for root), <code>2</code> means check after root.","tags":["Linux"]},{"location":"Linux/Linux%20Commands/#tar_command_examples","title":"Tar Command

For example, <code>app.use('/api', middlewareFunction)</code> would apply the middleware only to routes that start with <code>/api</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chain Multiple Middleware Functions: We can chain multiple middleware functions together using multiple <code>app.use()</code> calls, which will execute in the order they are added.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <pre><code>const express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n// Global Middleware\napp.use((req, res, next) =&gt; {\n    console.log('Middleware 1 - Global');\n    next(); // Pass control to the next middleware\n});\n\n// Middleware for a specific route\napp.use('/api', (req, res, next) =&gt; {\n    console.log('Middleware 2 - /api');\n    next();\n});\n\n// Another global middleware\napp.use((req, res, next) =&gt; {\n    console.log('Middleware 3 - Global');\n    next();\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () =&gt; {\n    console.log('Server started on port 3000...');\n});\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>Creating a Middleware function in Express involves defining a JavaScript function that takes three arguments: <code>req</code> (request), <code>res</code> (response), and <code>next</code>. The <code>next</code> argument is a function that, when called, passes control to the next middleware in the stack. If <code>next</code> is not called, the request-response cycle will not proceed beyond this middleware.</p> </li> <li> <p>Okay, let's start with simple global Middleware functions.

The <code>debug</code> package is particularly useful for gaining insights into the behavior of your application during development and troubleshooting issues.</p> <ul> <li>Namespaced Debugging: The <code>debug</code> package allows you to create debug instances with different namespaces. This makes it easy to categorize and control different parts of your application's debugging output.</li> <li>Environment-Based Control: Debugging logs can be enabled or disabled based on environment variables. This means you can keep the debug logs in your code and control their visibility without having to modify the code itself.</li> <li>Color-Coded Output: The <code>debug</code> package provides color-coded output for better readability of debugging messages.</li> <li>Configurable Output Streams: You can configure where the debugging logs are sent.

The installation process automatically handles the resolution of dependencies, ensuring that all required modules are downloaded and accessible. Version Management NPM provides version management for packages. Developers can specify the desired version of a package in the package.json file or use version ranges to allow updates within specific constraints. Package Publishing Developers can publish their own packages to the npm registry, making them available to others to use and contribute to. This fosters collaboration and code sharing within the Node.js community. Dependency Management NPM tracks dependencies and devDependencies of a project in the package.json file. This enables automated installation and management of all required modules by running a single command (npm install). Script Execution NPM allows developers to define custom scripts in the package.json file, which can be executed using the npm run command.

In every browser, we may have different JavaScript engines. Ex:</p> <ul> <li>Chakra is used for Edge</li> <li>SpiderMonkey is used for FireFox</li> <li>V8 is used for Chrome.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>So sometimes JavaScript codes can have differently in one browser or another.</p> </li> <li>Before the 2009, JavaScript only can be run on Browsers. But in 2009, Ryan Dahl the creator of Node came up with a brilliant idea. He thought it would be great to execute JavaScript outside of a browser, so he took Google's v8 engine, which is the fastest JavaScript engine out there, and embedded it inside a C++ program and called that program Node.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>So similar to a browser, Node is a runtime environment for JavaScript code. It contains a JavaScript engine that can execute our JavaScript code. But it also has certain objects that provide an environment for our JavaScript code. But these objects are different from the environment objects we have in browsers.

In these kind of applications, we have a lot of calculations that should be done by CPU, and few operations that touch the file system or the network.

XML is used to encode all communications to a web service. For example, a client invokes a web service by sending an XML message, then waits for a corresponding XML response. As all communication is in XML, web services are not tied to any one operating system or programming language - Java can talk with Perl; Windows applications can talk with Unix applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Web services are self-contained, modular, distributed, dynamic applications that can be described, published, located, or invoked over the network to create products, processes, and supply chains. These applications can be local, distributed, or web-based. Web services are built on top of open standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, Java, HTML, and XML.</p> </li> <li> <p>Web services are XML-based information exchange systems that use the Internet for direct application-to-application interaction. These systems can include programs, objects, messages, or documents.</p> </li> <li> <p>A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems. Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet in a manner similar to inter-process communication on a single computer.

You can transmit SOAP messages in any way that the applications require, as long as both the client and the server use the same method. The current specification describes only a single transport protocol binding, which is HTTP.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>SOAP</code> perfectly fits into the world of Internet applications and promises to improve Internet inter-operability for application services in the future. In essence, SOAP packages method calls into XML strings and delivers them to component instances through HTTP.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>SOAP</code> XML documents are structured around root elements, child elements with values, and other specifications. First an XML document containing a request (a method to be invoked and the parameters) is sent out. The server responds with a corresponding XML document that contains the results.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>SOAP</code> is not based on Microsoft technology. It is an open standard drafted by UserLand, Ariba, Commerce One, Compaq, Developmentor, HP, IBM, IONA, Lotus, Microsoft, and SAP. SOAP 1.1 was presented to the W3C in May 2000 as an official Internet standard. Microsoft is one of the greatest advocates of SOAP and has incorporated SOAP as a standard interface in the .NET architecture.</p> </li> <li> <p>A SOAP stack, an implementation of the SOAP standard on the client side, is comprised of libraries and classes that offer helper functions. A significant Web service testing challenge is that there are a number of SOAP stack implementations that are not compatible with one another. So although SOAP is intended to be both platform- and technology-independent, it is not. Web services written in .NET are however always compatible with .NET clients\u2014they use the same SOAP stack, or library. When testing a .NET Web service however, you need to confirm if the service is compatible with other SOAP stack implementations, for example Java SOAP stack, to avoid interoperability issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>SOAP client requests are encapsulated within HTTP POST or M-POST packages. The following example is taken from the Internet draft-specification.</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>POST /StockQuote HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.stockquoteserver.com\nContent-Type: text/xml;\ncharset=\"utf-8\"\nContent-Length: nnnn\nSOAPAction: \"Some-URI\"\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope\n  xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"\n  SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\"&gt;\n  &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;\n    &lt;m:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:m=\"Some-URI\"&gt;\n      &lt;symbol&gt;DIS&lt;/symbol&gt;\n    &lt;/m:GetLastTradePrice&gt;\n  &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;\n&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>The first four lines of code are standard HTTP. POST is the HTTP verb which is required for all HTTP messages. The\u00a0Content-Type\u00a0and\u00a0Content-Length\u00a0fields are required for all HTTP messages that contain payloads. The content-type\u00a0text/xml\u00a0indicates that the payload is an XML message to the server or a firewall capable of scanning application headers.</p> </li> <li> <p>The additional HTTP header\u00a0SOAPAction\u00a0is mandatory for HTTP based SOAP messages, and you can use it to indicate the intent of a SOAP HTTP request. The value is a URI that identifies the intent. The content of a\u00a0SOAPAction\u00a0header field can be used by servers, for example firewalls, to appropriately filter SOAP request messages in HTTP. An empty string (\"\") as the header-field value indicates that the intent of the SOAP message is provided by the HTTP Request-URI. No value means that there is no indication on the intent of the message.</p> </li> <li> <p>The XML code is straightforward. The elements\u00a0Envelope\u00a0and\u00a0Body\u00a0offer a generic payload-packaging mechanism. The element\u00a0GetLastTradePrice\u00a0contains an element called\u00a0symbol, which contains a stock-ticker symbol. The purpose of this request is to get the last trading price of a specific stock, in this case Disney (DIS).</p> </li> <li> <p>The program that sends this message only needs to understand how to frame a request in a SOAP-complient XML message and how to send it through HTTP. In the following example, the program knows how to format a request for a stock price. The HTTP server that receives the message knows that it is a SOAP message because it recognizes the HTTP header\u00a0SOAPAction. The server then processes the message.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>SOAP</code> defines two types of messages,\u00a0<code>calls</code>\u00a0and\u00a0<code>responses</code>, to allow clients to request remote procedures and to allow servers to respond to such a request. The previous example is an example of a call. The following example comes as a response in answer to the call.</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/xml;\ncharset=\"utf-8\"\nContent-Length: nnnn\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope\n  xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"\n  SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\"/&gt;\n  &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;\n    &lt;m:GetLastTradePriceResponse xmlns:m=\"Some-URI\"&gt;\n      &lt;Price&gt;34.5&lt;/Price&gt;\n    &lt;/m:GetLastTradePriceResponse&gt;\n  &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;\n&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>The first three lines of code are standard HTTP. The first line indicates a response code to the previous POST request, the second and third line indicate the content type and the fourth line the lenght of the response.</p> </li> <li> <p>XML headers enclose the actual SOAP payloads.

IBM\u00ae maintains two public registries called the IBM UDDI Business Registry and the IBM UDDI Test Registry.

The information provided in the registry consists of three components: white pages, yellow pages, and green pages. White pages include the business name, contact information, and a text description of the business's services. Yellow pages include industrial categorizations based on standard taxonomies such as NAICS, ISO 3166, and UNSPSC. Green pages include references to specifications for Web services and pointers to various file and URL-based discovery mechanisms. This makes it easy for businesses to integrate across marketplaces. Because it is registered, information is made available across all applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Businesses populate the registry with descriptions of the services that they support. <code>UDDI</code> assigns a unique identifier to each service description and business registration.

Transaction management is a good example of a crosscutting concern in enterprise Java applications. In Spring AOP, aspects are implemented by using regular classes (the schema-based approach) or regular classes annotated with the @Aspect annotation (the @AspectJ style). Join point A point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception. In Spring AOP, a join point always represents a method execution. Advice Action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Different types of advice include \"around\", \"before\", and \"after\" advice. (Advice types are discussed later.) Many AOP frameworks, including Spring, model an advice as an interceptor and maintain a chain of interceptors around the join point. Pointcut A predicate that matches join points. Advice is associated with a pointcut expression and runs at any join point matched by the pointcut (for example, the execution of a method with a certain name). The concept of join points as matched by pointcut expressions is central to AOP, and Spring uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language by default. Introduction Declaring additional methods or fields on behalf of a type. Spring AOP lets you introduce new interfaces (and a corresponding implementation) to any advised object. For example, you could use an introduction to make a bean implement an IsModified interface, to simplify caching. (An introduction is known as an inter-type declaration in the AspectJ community.) Target object An object being advised by one or more aspects. Also referred to as the \"advised object\". Since Spring AOP is implemented by using runtime proxies, this object is always a proxied object. AOP proxy An object created by the AOP framework in order to implement the aspect contracts (advice method executions and so on). In the Spring Framework, an AOP proxy is a JDK dynamic proxy or a CGLIB proxy. Weaving Linking aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object. This can be done at compile time (using the AspectJ compiler, for example), load time, or at runtime. Spring AOP, like other pure Java AOP frameworks, performs weaving at runtime. <ul> <li>Spring AOP includes the following types of advice.</li> </ul> Advice Type Description Before advice Advice that runs before a join point but that does not have the ability to prevent execution flow proceeding to the join point (unless it throws an exception). After returning advice Advice to be run after a join point completes normally (for example, if a method returns without throwing an exception). After throwing advice Advice to be run if a method exits by throwing an exception. After (finally) advice Advice to be run regardless of the means by which a join point exits (normal or exceptional return). Around advice Advice that surrounds a join point such as a method invocation. This is the most powerful kind of advice. Around advice can perform custom behavior before and after the method invocation. It is also responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the join point or to shortcut the advised method execution by returning its own return value or throwing an exception.","tags":["Spring","SpringBoot","SpringBoot3"]},{"location":"Spring%20Boot/Spring%20Boot%203.x%20AOP%20Introduction/#benefit_of_aop","title":"Benefit Of AOP","text":"<ul> <li>Reusable Aspects: AOP allows the encapsulation of cross-cutting concerns into reusable modules or classes (aspects).</li> <li>Configuration-Based Application: Aspects can be applied selectively to different parts of the project based on configuration.</li> <li>Cross-Cutting Logic Encapsulation: AOP helps in encapsulating common logic, making it easier to manage and maintain.</li> <li>Cleaner Business Code: Business-specific code remains focused on core functionalities, reducing complexity.</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringBoot","SpringBoot3"]},{"location":"Spring%20Boot/Spring%20Boot%203.x%20AOP%20Introduction/#aop_use_cases","title":"AOP Use Cases","text":"<ul> <li>Exception handling: log exception and notify DevOps team via SMS/email</li> <li>Api Management: how many times has a method been called user, analytics: what are peak times? what is average load? who is top user?<ul> <li>Common Use Cases: Logging, security, and transactions are common AOP use cases.</li> <li>Additional Use Cases: AOP can be used for audit logging, exception handling, API management, and other cross-cutting concerns.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringBoot","SpringBoot3"]},{"location":"Spring%20Boot/Spring%20Boot%203.x%20AOP%20Introduction/#aop_advantages","title":"AOP Advantages","text":"<ul> <li>Reusable Modules: Aspects serve as reusable modules to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns.</li> <li>Code Tangling and Scattering Resolution: Addresses issues of code tangling and scattering.</li> <li>Selective Application: Aspects can be applied selectively based on configuration.</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringBoot","SpringBoot3"]},{"location":"Spring%20Boot/Spring%20Boot%203.x%20AOP%20Introduction/#aop_disavantages","title":"AOP Disavantages","text":"<ul> <li>Complexity with Too Many Aspects: If there are too many aspects, the application flow can become hard to follow.

false. In draft-07, they are required and default to false and true, respectively. Incompatible $ref In draft-04, $ref can reference any JSON Schema definition, including definitions defined inline. In draft-07, $ref can only reference definitions that are defined outside the current schema. Incompatible additionalProperties and patternProperties In draft-04, these keywords were not mutually exclusive, meaning that both could be used to define properties in an object. In draft-07, they are mutually exclusive, and if patternProperties is used, additionalProperties can only be used to define boolean values. Incompatible type In draft-04, type can be a string or an array of strings. In draft-07, type must be a string, and if multiple types are allowed, they must be listed in an array under the anyOf keyword. Incompatible dependencies In draft-04, dependencies can only define the dependencies between properties in an object. In draft-07, dependencies can also define schema dependencies, where the presence or absence of a property is dependent on whether another property validates against a given schema. Incompatible maximum and minimum In draft-04, maximum and minimum can be any numeric value. In draft-07, they must be finite numbers, and the use of NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity is prohibited. Incompatible oneOf, anyOf, and allOf In draft-04, these keywords do not support if/then/else clauses, and their behavior is not well-defined when used with other schema keywords like additionalProperties. In draft-07, they have well-defined behavior and can be used with if/then/else clauses.

When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.</p> </li> <li> <p>An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.</p> </li> <li>More Information.</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringBoot"]},{"location":"Spring%20Boot/Spring%20Boot%20With%20OpenApi/#dependencies_and_plugins","title":"Dependencies And Plugins","text":"<ul> <li>You need to import some dependencies below into <code>pom.xml</code> of your spring boot project for needed imports, validation annotations and OpenApi UI for your generated classes.  </li> </ul> pom.xml<pre><code>...\n\n&lt;!--Openapi UI with validation--&gt;  \n&lt;dependency&gt;  \n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.core&lt;/groupId&gt;  \n    &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;  \n    &lt;version&gt;2.13.1&lt;/version&gt;  \n&lt;/dependency&gt;  \n\n&lt;dependency&gt;  \n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.core&lt;/groupId&gt;  \n    &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-annotations&lt;/artifactId&gt;  \n    &lt;version&gt;2.13.1&lt;/version&gt;  \n&lt;/dependency&gt;  \n\n&lt;dependency&gt;  \n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.openapitools&lt;/groupId&gt;  \n    &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-databind-nullable&lt;/artifactId&gt;  \n    &lt;version&gt;0.2.2&lt;/version&gt;  \n&lt;/dependency&gt;  \n\n&lt;dependency&gt;  \n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springdoc&lt;/groupId&gt;  \n    &lt;artifactId&gt;springdoc-openapi-ui&lt;/artifactId&gt;  \n    &lt;version&gt;1.6.5&lt;/version&gt;  \n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n\n...\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Then for the OpenApi Generator, let's put the plugin below into your <code>pom.xml</code> with some configurations.</li> </ul> pom.xml<pre><code>   &lt;build&gt;\n        &lt;plugins&gt;\n            &lt;plugin&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.openapitools&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;openapi-generator-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                &lt;version&gt;5.4.0&lt;/version&gt;\n                &lt;executions&gt;\n                    &lt;execution&gt;\n                        &lt;goals&gt;\n                            &lt;goal&gt;generate&lt;/goal&gt;\n                        &lt;/goals&gt;\n                        &lt;configuration&gt;\n                            &lt;!-- path to the openapi file spec `.yml` --&gt;\n                            &lt;inputSpec&gt;\n                                ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/openapi/openapi-server.yml\n                            &lt;/inputSpec&gt;\n                            &lt;generatorName&gt;spring&lt;/generatorName&gt;\n                            &lt;!-- generated package for api interface --&gt;\n                            &lt;apiPackage&gt;com.springboot.cloud.openfeign.openapi.server.app.api&lt;/apiPackage&gt;\n                            &lt;!-- generated package for models --&gt;\n                            &lt;modelPackage&gt;com.springboot.cloud.openfeign.openapi.server.app.model&lt;/modelPackage&gt;\n                            &lt;!-- using supportingFilesToGenerate --&gt;\n                            &lt;supportingFilesToGenerate&gt;\n                                ApiUtil.java\n                            &lt;/supportingFilesToGenerate&gt;\n                            &lt;configOptions&gt;\n                                &lt;delegatePattern&gt;true&lt;/delegatePattern&gt;\n                                &lt;dateLibrary&gt;java8&lt;/dateLibrary&gt;\n                                &lt;interfaceOnly&gt;true&lt;/interfaceOnly&gt;\n                                &lt;useBeanValidation&gt;true&lt;/useBeanValidation&gt;\n                            &lt;/configOptions&gt;\n                        &lt;/configuration&gt;\n                    &lt;/execution&gt;\n                &lt;/executions&gt;\n            &lt;/plugin&gt;\n        &lt;/plugins&gt;\n    &lt;/build&gt;\n</code></pre>","tags":["Spring","SpringBoot"]},{"location":"Spring%20Boot/Spring%20Boot%20With%20OpenApi/#openapi_implementation_and_configuration","title":"OpenApi Implementation And Configuration","text":"<ul> <li>Now let create swagger package in the <code>resources</code> folder and create <code>swagger-input.yml</code> with your api definitions.

The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger. Why is it so great? Well, by reading your API\u2019s structure, we can automatically build beautiful and interactive API documentation. We can also automatically generate client libraries for your API in many languages and explore other possibilities like automated testing. Swagger does this by asking your API to return a YAML or JSON that contains a detailed description of your entire API.

This will make the database execute thousands queries and it will lead to bad performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>To avoid it, we will use the <code>Entity Graphs</code> which are a feature introduced in JPA 2.1 that provides a more sophisticated method of dealing with performance loading.  They provide a way to define which attributes (fields) of an entity should be loaded from the database when the entity is fetched. This can be particularly useful when dealing with entities that have relationships with other entities.</p> </li> <li> <p>The main goal of the JPA <code>Entity Graph</code> is to improve the runtime performance when loading the entity\u2019s related associations and basic fields1. The JPA provider loads all the graphs in one select query and then avoids fetching associations with more <code>SELECT</code> queries. This is considered a good approach for improving application performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>In Spring Boot, we can define an <code>Entity Graph</code> using a combination of <code>@NamedEntityGraph</code> and<code>@EntityGraph</code> annotations. We can also define ad-hoc entity graphs with just the <code>attributePaths</code> argument of the <code>@EntityGraph</code> annotation.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringBoot","SpringBoot3","SpringBootNotes"]},{"location":"Spring%20Boot/Some%20Notes/Fix%20Jpa%20OneToOne%20N%2B1%20Issue/#with_namedentitygraph","title":"With @NamedEntityGraph","text":"<pre><code>package com.springboot.project.entity;\n\nimport jakarta.persistence.CascadeType;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Column;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Entity;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EnumType;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Enumerated;\nimport jakarta.persistence.FetchType;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GenerationType;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Id;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Index;\nimport jakarta.persistence.JoinColumn;\nimport jakarta.persistence.NamedAttributeNode;\nimport jakarta.persistence.NamedEntityGraph;\nimport jakarta.persistence.OneToMany;\nimport jakarta.persistence.OneToOne;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Table;\nimport lombok.Getter;\nimport lombok.Setter;\nimport org.hibernate.annotations.Fetch;\nimport org.hibernate.annotations.FetchMode;\n\nimport java.util.Date;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.UUID;\n\n@Getter\n@Setter\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"customers\", indexes = {\n        @Index(name = \"uniqueEmailIndex\", columnList = \"email\", unique = true),\n        @Index(name = \"uniquePhoneIndex\", columnList = \"phone\", unique = true),\n        @Index(name = \"uniqueMultiIndex\", columnList = \"email, phone\", unique = true)\n})\n@NamedEntityGraph(name = \"CustomerEntity.loyaltyCard\", attributeNodes = @NamedAttributeNode(\"loyaltyCard\"))\npublic class CustomerEntity {\n\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.UUID)\n    private UUID id;\n    private String fullName;\n    @Column(unique = true)\n    private String email;\n    private String address;\n    @Column(unique = true)\n    private String phone;\n    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)\n    private Gender gender;\n    private Date dob;\n\n    @JoinColumn(name = \"loyalty_card\")\n    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n    private LoyaltyCardEntity loyaltyCard;\n\n    @Fetch(FetchMode.SUBSELECT)\n    @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"customer\", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\n    private List&lt;OrderEntity&gt;

at\u00a0<code>target/generated-sources/openapi/src/main/java/**</code>\u00a0and you should see your generated codes as in the image below:</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Next, to openfeign can recognize and use your generated client apis, you should create a configuration class and make some configuration as below:</li> </ul> FeignClientConfig.java<pre><code>package com.springboot.cloud.openfeign.openapi.client.app.config;\n\nimport com.springboot.cloud.openfeign.openapi.server.app.api.ServerApi;\nimport

this class we will use\u00a0<code>ApplicationContext</code>\u00a0and generated client api class\u00a0<code>ServerApi</code>\u00a0to create\u00a0<code>ServerApi</code>\u00a0feign client. At this point you will confuse that how client can connect to server, so connecting to\u00a0<code>openfeign-openapi-client</code>\u00a0will be handle apart by\u00a0<code>eureka-server</code>. both\u00a0<code>openfeign-openapi-client</code>\u00a0and\u00a0<code>openfeign-openapi-server</code>\u00a0are connected to\u00a0<code>eureka-server</code>, so its know exactly the application names and urls correspondingly. Thus, in spring cloud openfeign, we just use the application name of\u00a0<code>openfeign-openapi-server</code>\u00a0then we can make the connection to. Doing this way, we won\u2019t worry about changing url or port on\u00a0<code>openfeign-openapi-server</code>\u00a0anymore.</p> </li> <li> <p>Note: we should use application name with all capital letters because\u00a0<code>eureka-server</code>\u00a0will automatically capitalize all application names of clients when they connect to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, we will create a controller with an api, this api will use openfeign client that we configure above to get data from\u00a0<code>openfeign-openapi-server</code>. The controller is as below:</p> </li> </ul> ClientController.java<pre><code>package com.springboot.cloud.openfeign.openapi.client.app.controller;\n\nimport com.springboot.cloud.openfeign.openapi.server.app.api.ServerApi;\nimport com.springboot.cloud.openfeign.openapi.server.app.model.Customer;\nimport lombok.AllArgsConstructor;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\nimport org.springframework.http.MediaType;\nimport org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\n@RestController\n@AllArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Autowired))\npublic class ClientController {\n\n    private final ServerApi serverApi;\n\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = \"/v1/client/customers\", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;Customer&gt;&gt; getCustomer() {\n        return this.serverApi._getCustomers();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>","tags":["Spring","SpringCloud","SpringBoot"]},{"location":"Spring%20Cloud/OpenApi%20-%20OpenFeign%20Integration/#testing","title":"Testing","text":"<ul> <li>Let\u2019s start 3 services, then go to\u00a0<code>http://localhost:8761/eureka</code>\u00a0to check the client connections.

Feign also supports pluggable encoders and decoders. </li> <li><code>Feign</code> uses tools like Jersey and CXF to write java clients for REST or SOAP services. Furthermore, <code>Feign</code> allows you to write your own code on top of http libraries such as Apache HC. <code>Feign</code> connects your code to http APIs with minimal overhead and code via customizable decoders and error handling, which can be written to any text-based http API.</li> <li><code>Feign</code> works by processing annotations into a templatized request. Arguments are applied to these templates in a straightforward fashion before output. Although <code>Feign</code> is limited to supporting text-based APIs, it dramatically simplifies system aspects such as replaying requests.

Feign's default contract defines the following annotations:</li> </ul> Annotation Interface Target Usage @RequestLine Method Defines the HttpMethod and UriTemplate for request. Expressions, values wrapped in curly-braces {expression} are resolved using their corresponding @Param annotated parameters. @Param Parameter Defines a template variable, whose value will be used to resolve the corresponding template Expression, by name provided as annotation value. If value is missing it will try to get the name from bytecode method parameter name (if the code was compiled with -parameters flag). @Headers Method Type    Defines a HeaderTemplate; a variation on a UriTemplate. that uses @Param annotated values to resolve the corresponding Expressions. When used on a Type, the template will be applied to every request. When used on a Method, the template will apply only to the annotated method. @QueryMap Parameter Defines a Map of name-value pairs, or POJO, to expand into a query string. @HeaderMap Parameter Defines a Map of name-value pairs, to expand into Http Headers @Body Method Defines a Template, similar to a UriTemplate and HeaderTemplate, that uses @Param annotated values to resolve the corresponding Expressions.","tags":["Spring","SpringCloud","SpringBoot"]},{"location":"Spring%20Cloud/Spring%20Cloud%20OpenFeign%20Basic/#what_is_the_spring_cloud_openfeign","title":"What Is The Spring Cloud OpenFeign?","text":"<ul> <li><code>Spring Cloud Openfeign</code> provides OpenFeign integrations for  Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms.</li> <li>Spring Cloud adds support for Spring MVC annotations and for using the same <code>HttpMessageConverters</code> used by default in Spring Web.

Log4j2 offers advanced logging capabilities and allows you to configure logging using various configurations. It's commonly used for application logging in Spring Boot projects. org.apache.kafka:kafka-log4j-appender:2.8.2 This dependency provides the Log4j appender for Kafka. It enables you to send log messages from your application to a Kafka topic, which can then be consumed by various consumers for centralized logging and analysis. This is useful for distributing and managing logs in a distributed system. org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-spring-cloud-config-client:2.17.2 This dependency integrates Log4j with Spring Cloud Config, allowing you to manage your logging configuration centrally using Spring Cloud Config Server. This is particularly useful in microservices architectures where you have multiple instances of the same application and want to manage their logging configuration externally. The exclusion of <code>spring-cloud-bus</code> prevents unnecessary dependencies that are not needed for this purpose.","tags":["Spring","SpringCloud","SpringBoot"]},{"location":"Spring%20Cloud/Spring%20Cloud%20Sleuth%20With%20Zipkin%20And%20Kibana/#controller","title":"Controller","text":"<ul> <li>Next, let's create a simple controller with 2 Apis as below.</li> </ul> ProductController.java<pre><code>package com.springboot.cloud.sleuth.log4j2.kafka.zipkin.product.service.controller;\n\nimport lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;\nimport org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\n\n@RestController\n@Slf4j\npublic class ProductController {\n\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = \"/v1/application/product/message\")\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; getMessage() {\n        log.info(\"ProductController: getMessage\");\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(\"Hello From product Service\");\n    }\n\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = \"/v1/application/product/message/error\")\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; getErrorMessage() {\n        log.info(\"ProductController: getErrorMessage\");\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"ProductController: getErrorMessage\");\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>The first api will response some texts and the second api will return an error response.</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringCloud","SpringBoot"]},{"location":"Spring%20Cloud/Spring%20Cloud%20Sleuth%20With%20Zipkin%20And%20Kibana/#configuration_1","title":"Configuration","text":"<ul> <li>Firstly, we will use annotation <code>@EnableDiscoveryClient</code>  in the main class to enable discovery client.</li> </ul> <pre><code>package com.springboot.cloud.sleuth.log4j2.kafka.zipkin.product.service;\n\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\nimport org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;\n\n@SpringBootApplication\n@EnableDiscoveryClient\npublic class SleuthLog4j2KafkaZipkinProductService {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SpringApplication.run(SleuthLog4j2KafkaZipkinProductService.class, args);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Next, let's create a configuration class <code>SleuthConfig</code> with the content as below.</li> </ul> SleuthConfig.java<pre><code>package com.springboot.cloud.sleuth.log4j2.kafka.zipkin.product.service.config;\n\nimport brave.baggage.BaggageFields;\nimport brave.baggage.CorrelationScopeConfig;\nimport brave.baggage.CorrelationScopeCustomizer;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\n\n@Configuration\npublic class SleuthConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    CorrelationScopeCustomizer addSampled() {\n        return b -&gt; b.add(CorrelationScopeConfig.SingleCorrelationField.create(BaggageFields.SAMPLED));\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    CorrelationScopeCustomizer addParentId() {\n        return b -&gt; b.add(CorrelationScopeConfig.SingleCorrelationField.create(BaggageFields.PARENT_ID));\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Okay, currently we are using <code>spring-cloud-dependencies</code> version <code>2021.0.0</code> and behind the scene, it will automatically set the <code>spring-cloud-sleuth</code> version <code>3.1.0</code> for us.

Log4j2 offers advanced logging capabilities and allows you to configure logging using various configurations. It's commonly used for application logging in Spring Boot projects. org.apache.kafka:kafka-log4j-appender:2.8.2 This dependency provides the Log4j appender for Kafka. It enables you to send log messages from your application to a Kafka topic, which can then be consumed by various consumers for centralized logging and analysis. This is useful for distributing and managing logs in a distributed system. org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-spring-cloud-config-client:2.17.2 This dependency integrates Log4j with Spring Cloud Config, allowing you to manage your logging configuration centrally using Spring Cloud Config Server. This is particularly useful in microservices architectures where you have multiple instances of the same application and want to manage their logging configuration externally. The exclusion of <code>spring-cloud-bus</code> prevents unnecessary dependencies that are not needed for this purpose.","tags":["Spring","SpringCloud","SpringBoot"]},{"location":"Spring%20Cloud/Spring%20Cloud%20Sleuth%20With%20Zipkin%20And%20Kibana/#controller_1","title":"Controller","text":"<ul> <li>Next, let's create a simple controller with 3 Apis as below. </li> </ul> CustomerController.java<pre><code>package com.springboot.cloud.sleuth.log4j2.kafka.zipkin.customer.service.controller;\n\nimport com.springboot.cloud.sleuth.log4j2.kafka.zipkin.customer.service.api.ProductServiceApi;\nimport lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\nimport org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\n\n@RestController\n@Slf4j\npublic class CustomerController {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private ProductServiceApi productServiceApi;\n\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = \"/v1/application/customer/message\")\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; getMessage() {\n        log.info(\"Start CustomerController: getMessage\");\n        log.info(\"Call Product Service method getProductMessage: 1\");\n        String productMessage = this.productServiceApi.getProductMessage();\n        log.info(\"Content From Product Service: \" + productMessage);\n        log.info(\"Call Product Service method getProductMessage: 2\");\n        String productMessage2 = this.productServiceApi.getProductMessage();\n        log.info(\"Content From Product Service: \" + productMessage2);\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(\"Hello From application adapter Service\");\n    }\n\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = \"/v1/application/customer/message/error\")\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; getErrorMessage() {\n        log.info(\"CustomerController: getErrorMessage\");\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"CustomerController: getErrorMessage\");\n    }\n\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = \"/v1/application/customer/message/error2\")\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; getErrorMessage2() {\n        log.info(\"CustomerController: getErrorMessage2\");\n        log.info(\"Call Product Service method getProductMessage\");\n        String productMessage = this.productServiceApi.getProductMessage();\n        log.info(\"Content From Product Service: \" + productMessage);\n        log.info(\"Call Product Service method getErrorMessage\");\n        this.productServiceApi.getErrorMessage();\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(\"CustomerController: getErrorMessage\");\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>On the first it just simply call to <code>product-service</code> two time and will receive some text responses.

Log4j2 offers advanced logging capabilities and allows you to configure logging using various configurations. It's commonly used for application logging in Spring Boot projects. org.apache.kafka:kafka-log4j-appender:2.8.2 This dependency provides the Log4j appender for Kafka. It enables you to send log messages from your application to a Kafka topic, which can then be consumed by various consumers for centralized logging and analysis. This is useful for distributing and managing logs in a distributed system. org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-spring-cloud-config-client:2.17.2 This dependency integrates Log4j with Spring Cloud Config, allowing you to manage your logging configuration centrally using Spring Cloud Config Server. This is particularly useful in microservices architectures where you have multiple instances of the same application and want to manage their logging configuration externally. The exclusion of <code>spring-cloud-bus</code> prevents unnecessary dependencies that are not needed for this purpose.","tags":["Spring","SpringCloud","SpringBoot"]},{"location":"Spring%20Cloud/Spring%20Cloud%20Sleuth%20With%20Zipkin%20And%20Kibana/#controller_2","title":"Controller","text":"<ul> <li>Next, let's create a simple controller with 4 Apis as below. </li> </ul> BffApplicationController.java<pre><code>package com.springboot.cloud.sleuth.log4j2.kafka.zipkin.bff.application.service.controller;\n\nimport com.springboot.cloud.sleuth.log4j2.kafka.zipkin.bff.application.service.api.CustomerServiceApi;\nimport com.springboot.cloud.sleuth.log4j2.kafka.zipkin.bff.application.service.api.ProductServiceApi;\nimport lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\nimport org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod;\n\n@Controller\n@Slf4j\npublic class BffApplicationController {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private CustomerServiceApi customerServiceApi;\n    @Autowired\n    private ProductServiceApi productServiceApi;\n\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = \"/v1/bff/customer/message\")\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt;

It differs from a normal\u00a0<code>ApplicationContext</code>\u00a0in that it is capable of resolving themes, and that it knows which servlet it is associated with (by having a link to the\u00a0<code>ServletContext</code>). The\u00a0<code>WebApplicationContext</code>\u00a0is bound in the\u00a0<code>ServletContext</code>, and by using static methods on the\u00a0<code>RequestContextUtils</code>\u00a0class we can always look up the\u00a0<code>WebApplicationContext</code>\u00a0if we need access to it.</li> <li> <p>The Spring\u00a0<code>DispatcherServlet</code>\u00a0uses special beans to process requests and render the appropriate views. These beans are part of Spring Framework. We can configure them in the\u00a0<code>WebApplicationContext</code>, just as we configure any other bean. However, for most beans, sensible defaults are provided so we initially do not need to configure them. These beans are described in the following table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Special beans in the <code>WebApplicationContext</code>:</p> </li> </ul> Bean type Explanation controllers Form the C part of the MVC. handler mappings Handle the execution of a list of pre-processors and post-processors and controllers that will be executed if they match certain criteria (for example, a matching URL specified with the controller). view resolvers Resolves view names to views. locale resolver A locale resolver is a component capable of resolving the locale a client is using, in order to be able to offer internationalized views Theme resolver A theme resolver is capable of resolving themes our web application can use, for example, to offer personalized layouts multipart file resolver Contains functionality to process file uploads from HTML forms. handler exception resolvers Contains functionality to map exceptions to views or implement other more complex exception handling code. <ul> <li> <p>After we set up a <code>DispatcherServlet</code>, and a request comes in for that specific <code>DispatcherServlet</code>, the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> starts processing the request as follows:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>WebApplicationContext</code> is searched for and bound in the request as an attribute that the controller and other elements in the process can use. It is bound by default under the key DispatcherServlet.WEB_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE.</li> <li>The locale resolver is bound to the request to enable elements in the process to resolve the locale to use when processing the request (rendering the view, preparing data, and so on). If we do not need locale resolving, we do not need it.</li> <li>The theme resolver is bound to the request to let elements such as views determine which theme to use. If we do not use themes, we can ignore it.</li> <li>If we specify a multipart file resolver, the request is inspected for multiparts; if multiparts are found, the request is wrapped in a <code>MultipartHttpServletRequest</code> for further processing by other elements in the process.</li> <li>An appropriate handler is searched for. If a handler is found, the execution chain associated with the handler (preprocessors, postprocessors, and controllers) is executed in order to prepare a model or rendering.</li> <li>If a model is returned, the view is rendered. If no model is returned, (may be due to a preprocessor or postprocessor intercepting the request, perhaps for security reasons), no view is rendered, because the request could already have been fulfilled.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Handler exception resolvers that are declared in the\u00a0<code>WebApplicationContext</code>\u00a0pick up exceptions that are thrown during processing of the request. Using these exception resolvers allows us to define custom behaviors to address exceptions.</p> </li> <li>The Spring\u00a0<code>DispatcherServlet</code>\u00a0also supports the return of the\u00a0<code>last-modification-date</code>, as specified by the Servlet API. The process of determining the last modification date for a specific request is straightforward: <ul> <li>The\u00a0<code>DispatcherServlet</code>\u00a0looks up an appropriate handler mapping and tests whether the handler that is found implements the\u00a0<code>LastModified</code>\u00a0interface. If so, the value of the\u00a0<code>long getLastModified(request)</code>\u00a0method of the\u00a0<code>LastModified</code>\u00a0interface is returned to the client.</li> </ul> </li> <li>We can customize Spring's\u00a0<code>DispatcherServlet</code>\u00a0by adding context parameters in the\u00a0<code>web.xml</code>\u00a0file or servlet initialization parameters. See the following table.</li> <li><code>DispatcherServlet</code> initialization parameters:</li> </ul> Parameter Explanation contextClass Class that implements WebApplicationContext, which instantiates the context used by this servlet. By default, the XmlWebApplicationContext is used. contextConfigLocation String that is passed to the context instance (specified by contextClass) to indicate where context(s) can be found.

On DEV environment you know that your application with version 1.0 will work perfectly and ready for testing. However, on DEV you are testing your application with version 2.0 and the table structures in the database of this version is quite different with the version 1.0. So you have to find a way to prepare the correct table structures of version 1.0 for the TEST environment.</p> <ul> <li>You have to trace back the source code or recheck the US to find what is the correct table structures when you worked with version 1.0.</li> <li>When you have the correct tables structures, you have to go to TEST database and use SQL scripts to initialize tables.</li> <li>If you don't note what did you do so in future you can forget or other teammates or other new member will not know  what SQL scripts of table structures that you applied into TEST database, version 1.0 or 1.1 or 1.2..etc?</li> <li>It is hard for you to maintain table structures of database following versions of your application.</li> <li>If you checkout another version of your source code and you do some test and got errors.

Whereas <code>Hibernate</code> manages the exceptions itself by marking them as unchecked. 4. <code>JDBC</code> is database dependent i.e. one needs to write different codes for different database. Whereas <code>Hibernate</code> is database independent and same code can work for many databases with minor changes. 5. Creating associations between relations is quite hard in <code>JDBC</code>.

Not surprisingly, Spring comes with its own implementation of this pattern, named OpenSessionInViewInterceptor, to facilitate working with lazy associations and therefore, improving developer productivity.</li> <li>By default In  SpringBoot Service, JPA use OSIV (Open session in view) parttern with <code>open-in-view=true</code> configuration which allow a session will be created when the a HTTP request come in the <code>SpringBoot</code> service and this session will be closed until the HTTP request has been end. This session is bound into the TransactionSynchronizationManager. So It means that there is a Transaction that will be opened from from the beginning to the end of the HTTP request. So that's the reason why although you put a lot of queries and do update to many tables in Database or get child entities from parent entities you just can see in the log just one <code>JDBC</code> connection is used (physical database connection) with many SQL statements. So, if your service is small and you don't call any request to another system, just work with your DB so it is okay for you, you can manipulate with data in DB anywhere in your service methods. But if you have to call to another system, so using this way is not too good, because the <code>transaction</code> and database connection will be hold for a long time and can make the connection pool become full if there are may request at the same time, you can see this issue happen when you run your springboot service on production.</li> <li>If we set <code>open-in-view=false</code>, then be careful when you use Lazy loading because now, every executed query will be made in a <code>transaction</code> and connection privately, you can image that if there are 3 queries in your service method, so every time the query is executed, then a <code>transaction</code> and connection will be created and executed into the database and closed, then 3 queries you will have 3 times to make connections to DB. So if you use lazy load, you get parent from the first query, then you get childs from parent the LazyInitializationException will be through because the <code>transaction</code> of getting parent has been closed. So using this way is better when your service is interacting with many systems, the DB connections in pool will not be hold for a long time and we can improve our service performance on production when we received many connections because connections are opened and closed instantly.</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringData"]},{"location":"Spring%20Data/Open%20Session%20In%20View%20Of%20JPA/#see_also","title":"See Also","text":"<ul> <li>Spring Data JPA</li> <li>Transaction</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringData"]},{"location":"Spring%20Data/Open%20Session%20In%20View%20Of%20JPA/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>You can find more here</li> <li>You can find more here</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringData"]},{"location":"Spring%20Data/Persistence%20Context/","title":"Persistence Context Introduction","text":"","tags":["Spring","SpringData"]},{"location":"Spring%20Data/Persistence%20Context/#what_is_the_persistence_context","title":"What Is The Persistence Context","text":"<ul> <li><code>Persistence context</code>: The <code>persistence context</code> defines the set of active instances that the application is handling.

The most common type of search is to find all documents containing given query terms and return them in order of their similarity to the query. Notions of query and similarity are very flexible and depend on the specific application. The simplest search considers query as a set of words and similarity as the frequency of query words in the document.</p> </li> <li> <p>Textual search operators have existed in databases for years.\u00a0PostgreSQL\u00a0has\u00a0<code>~</code>,\u00a0<code>~*</code>,\u00a0<code>LIKE</code>, and\u00a0<code>ILIKE</code>\u00a0operators for textual data types, but they lack many essential properties required by modern information systems:</p> <ul> <li> <p>There is no linguistic support, even for English. Regular expressions are not sufficient because they cannot easily handle derived words, e.g.,\u00a0<code>satisfies</code>\u00a0and\u00a0<code>satisfy</code>. You might miss documents that contain\u00a0<code>satisfies</code>, although you probably would like to find them when searching for\u00a0<code>satisfy</code>. It is possible to use\u00a0<code>OR</code>\u00a0to search for multiple derived forms, but this is tedious and error-prone (some words can have several thousand derivatives).</p> </li> <li> <p>They provide no ordering (ranking) of search results, which makes them ineffective when thousands of matching documents are found.</p> </li> <li> <p>They tend to be slow because there is no index support, so they must process all documents for every search.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Full text indexing allows documents to be preprocessed and an index saved for later rapid searching. Preprocessing includes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Parsing documents into tokens. It is useful to identify various classes of tokens, e.g., numbers, words, complex words, email addresses, so that they can be processed differently. In principle token classes depend on the specific application, but for most purposes it is adequate to use a predefined set of classes. PostgreSQL uses a parser to perform this step. A standard parser is provided, and custom parsers can be created for specific needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Converting tokens into lexemes. A lexeme is a string, just like a token, but it has been normalized so that different forms of the same word are made alike. For example, normalization almost always includes folding upper-case letters to lower-case, and often involves removal of suffixes (such as s or es in English). This allows searches to find variant forms of the same word, without tediously entering all the possible variants. Also, this step typically eliminates stop words, which are words that are so common that they are useless for searching. (In short, then, tokens are raw fragments of the document text, while lexemes are words that are believed useful for indexing and searching.) PostgreSQL uses dictionaries to perform this step. Various standard dictionaries are provided, and custom ones can be created for specific needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Storing preprocessed documents optimized for searching. For example, each document can be represented as a sorted array of normalized lexemes. Along with the lexemes it is often desirable to store positional information to use for proximity ranking, so that a document that contains a more \u201cdense\u201d region of query words is assigned a higher rank than one with scattered query words.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Dictionaries allow fine-grained control over how tokens are normalized. With appropriate dictionaries, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Define stop words that should not be indexed.</li> <li>Map synonyms to a single word using Ispell.</li> <li>Map phrases to a single word using a thesaurus.</li> <li>Map different variations of a word to a canonical form using an Ispell dictionary.</li> <li>Map different variations of a word to a canonical form using Snowball stemmer rules.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>A data type <code>tsvector</code> is provided for storing preprocessed documents, along with a type <code>tsquery</code> for representing processed queries. There are many functions and operators available for these data types, the most important of which is the match operator <code>@@,</code> which we introduce in. <code>Full text searches</code> can be accelerated using indexes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document Source</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringData"]},{"location":"Spring%20Data/SB%203x%20JPA%20Native%20Query%20Postgres%20Full%20Text%20Search/#what_is_a_document","title":"What Is A Document?","text":"<ul> <li> <p><code>A document</code> is the unit of searching in a full text search system; for example, a magazine article or email message.

PostgreSQL provides support for all of these functions.</li> <li><code>PostgreSQL</code> provides the function <code>to_tsvector</code> for converting a <code>document</code> to the <code>tsvector</code> data type.</li> </ul> <pre><code>to_tsvector([ config regconfig, ] document text) returns tsvector\n</code></pre> <ul> <li><code>to_tsvector</code> parses a textual document into tokens, reduces the tokens to lexemes, and returns a <code>tsvector</code> which lists the lexemes together with their positions in the document. The document is processed according to the specified or default text search configuration. Here is a simple example:</li> </ul> <pre><code>SELECT to_tsvector('english','a fat cat sat on a mat - and ate a fat rat');\n</code></pre> to_tsvector 'ate':9 'cat':3 'fat':2,11 'mat':7 'rat':12 'sat':4 <ul> <li> <p>In the example above we see that the resulting <code>tsvector</code> does not contain the words <code>a</code>, <code>on</code> and <code>and</code> the word <code>rats</code> became <code>rat</code> and the punctuation sign\u00a0<code>-</code>\u00a0was ignored.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>to_tsvector</code> function internally calls a parser which breaks the <code>document</code> text into <code>tokens</code> and assigns a type to each token. For each <code>token</code>, a list of <code>dictionaries</code> is consulted, where the list can vary depending on the <code>token</code> type. The first dictionary that recognizes the <code>token</code> emits one or more normalized lexemes to represent the <code>token</code>. For example, <code>rats</code> became <code>rat</code> because one of the dictionaries recognized that the word <code>rats</code> is a plural form of <code>rat</code>. Some words are recognized as stop words, which causes them to be ignored since they occur too frequently to be useful in searching. In our example these are <code>a</code>, <code>on</code>, and <code>and</code>. If no dictionary in the list recognizes the token then it is also ignored. In this example that happened to the punctuation sign <code>-</code> because there are in fact no dictionaries assigned for its token type (Space symbols), meaning space tokens will never be indexed. The choices of parser, dictionaries and which types of tokens to index are determined by the selected text search configuration. It is possible to have many different configurations in the same database, and predefined configurations are available for various languages. In our example we used the default configuration <code>english</code> for the <code>English</code> language.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringData"]},{"location":"Spring%20Data/SB%203x%20JPA%20Native%20Query%20Postgres%20Full%20Text%20Search/#what_is_the_tsquery_datatype","title":"What Is The <code>tsquery</code> Datatype?","text":"<ul> <li>A\u00a0<code>tsquery</code>\u00a0value stores lexemes that are to be searched for, and can combine them using the Boolean operators\u00a0<code>&amp;</code>\u00a0(AND),\u00a0<code>|</code>\u00a0(OR), and\u00a0<code>!</code>\u00a0(NOT), as well as the phrase search operator\u00a0<code>&lt;-&gt;</code>\u00a0(FOLLOWED BY).

It works by creating a data structure known as an index, which allows for faster searching and accessing of data from the database.</li> <li>An index is a small table with two columns. The first column contains a copy of the primary or candidate key of a table, and the second column contains a set of pointers, each of which holds the address of the disk block where the specific key value is stored</li> <li>When a query needs to access a table that has an index, the database can use the index to retrieve records faster. The database finds the key value in the index, and each key value is stored with a pointer to the record in the table associated with this key value.</li> <li> <p>Indexes are not required for a database to function, but they can significantly improve query response time. However, they do require additional space to store the index records.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are different types of indexing methods such as Primary Indexing and Secondary Indexing. In Primary Indexing, there is a one-to-one relationship between entries in the index table. This type of indexing can be further divided into Dense Index, where a record is created for every search key value in the database, and Sparse Index, where an index record appears only for some of the values in the file.</p> </li> <li>Secondary Indexing can be generated by a field which has a unique value for each record, and it should be a candidate key. This type of indexing is used to reduce the mapping size of the first level.</li> <li> <p>In summary, indexing is a powerful technique that can greatly enhance the performance of a database by enabling faster retrieval of data.</p> </li> <li> <p>More information at learnsql.com and guru99.com</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringData"]},{"location":"Spring%20Data/SB%203x%20JPA%20With%20Indexing/#indexing_with_jpa_1","title":"Indexing With JPA","text":"<ul> <li>In JPA, we can create indexes for tables using the <code>@Index</code> annotation.

The JPA specification defines the  object-relational mapping (ORM) internally, rather than relying on vendor-specific mapping implementations, and uses either annotations or XML to map objects into database tables.

In which, ORDINAL: stored according to the enum value\u2019s ordinal position within the enum class, as indicated by java.lang.Enum#ordinal STRING: stored according to the enum value\u2019s name, as indicated by java.lang.Enum#name @OneToMany The @OneToMany annotation is used to specify a one-to-many database relationship. @ManyToOne The @ManyToOne annotation is used to specify a many-to-one database relationship. @JoinColumn The @JoinColumn annotation is used to specify the FOREIGN KEY column used when joining an entity association or an embeddable collection. @PrePersist The @PrePersist annotation is used to specify a callback method that fires before an entity is persisted. @PreUpdate The @PreUpdate annotation is used to specify a callback method that fires before an entity is updated. <ul> <li> <p>You can find more here.</p> </li> <li> <p>The fist Entity is <code>CustomerEntity</code>, this Entity will be the parent of <code>OrderEntity</code> and one <code>CustomerEntity</code> will have many <code>OrderEntity</code>.

If this time is exceeded without a connection becoming available, a SQLException will be thrown. Lowest acceptable connection timeout is 250 ms. 30000 30000 maximum-pool-size This property controls the maximum size that the pool is allowed to reach, including both idle and in-use connections. Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual connections to the database backend. A reasonable value for this is best determined by your execution environment. When the pool reaches this size, and no idle connections are available, calls to getConnection() will block for up to connectionTimeout milliseconds before timing out 10 20 minimumIdle This property controls the minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP tries to maintain in the pool. If the idle connections dip below this value and total connections in the pool are less than maximumPoolSize, HikariCP will make a best effort to add additional connections quickly and efficiently. However, for maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, we recommend not setting this value and instead allowing HikariCP to act as a fixed size connection pool. same as maximumPoolSize 15 idleTimeout This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool. This setting only applies when minimumIdle is defined to be less than maximumPoolSize. Idle connections will not be retired once the pool reaches minimumIdle connections. Whether a connection is retired as idle or not is subject to a maximum variation of +30 seconds, and average variation of +15 seconds. A connection will never be retired as idle before this timeout. A value of 0 means that idle connections are never removed from the pool. The minimum allowed value is 10000ms (10 seconds) 600000 (10 minutes) 30000 maxLifetime This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. An in-use connection will never be retired, only when it is closed will it then be removed. On a connection-by-connection basis, minor negative attenuation is applied to avoid mass-extinction in the pool. We strongly recommend setting this value, and it should be several seconds shorter than any database or infrastructure imposed connection time limit. A value of 0 indicates no maximum lifetime (infinite lifetime), subject of course to the idleTimeout setting. The minimum allowed value is 30000ms (30 seconds) 1800000 (30 minutes) 180000 <ul> <li> <p>You can find more here.</p> </li> <li> <p>For  JPA configuration properties, you can view the table below for more details.</p> </li> </ul> Configuration Properties Description Default Value Sample Configuration Value spring.jpa.database-platform Name of the target database to operate on, auto-detected by default.

With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker\u2019s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.</li> <li>Consider there are two websites, a victim is using the wedsite <code>abc.com</code> and the attacker's website is <code>xyz.com</code>. Also assume that the victim is logged in and his session is being maintained by Cookie. The attacker will:<ul> <li>Assume that the attacker knows the api for changing password of <code>abc.com</code> website with a POST request which contains the new password as a parameter.</li> <li>Then the attacker will place the request with change password in the HTML code on his website <code>xyz.com</code>. So that, It will imitate a legal request to <code>abc.com</code> (for example, a form with method as post and a hidden input field that contains the new password).</li> <li>So the attacker will make sure that the form is submitted by either using \"autosubmit\" when the HTML page of <code>xyz.com</code> is loaded or luring the victim to click on a submit button.</li> <li>When the victim visits <code>xyz.com</code> and that form is submitted, the victim's Web Browser makes a request to <code>abc.com</code> for a password change. Also the browser appends the session cookie automatically with the request. The server treats it as a genuine request and reset the victim's password to the attacker's supplied value. This way the victim's account gets taken over by the attacker.</li> </ul> </li> <li>There are many proposed way to implement CSRF protection on server side, among which the use of <code>CSRF tokens</code> is most popular. <code>A CSRF token</code> is a string that is tied to a user's Session but is not submitted automatically. </li> <li>For details, the server will generate a <code>CSRF token</code> and put in the response cookie for user's browser, so when the user on the <code>abc.com</code> makes a request to the server, the token will be added into the request header by <code>abc.com</code> and the server will check this token is valid or not to continue. Then if the user loads the <code>xyz.com</code> or click the submit button on <code>xyz.com</code> the request will also go to the server, however there is no the <code>CSRF token</code> in the request header because the browser is only add the session cookie automatically into the request header so the server will check this request and there is no <code>CSRF token</code> and the request will be rejected. If the attacker try to add the <code>CSRF token</code> header into the request so there is no way for him to know what is the valid token value that the user is using on <code>abc.com</code>.</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringSecurity"]},{"location":"Spring%20Security/CSRF%20-%20Cross-Site%20Request%20Forgery/#csrf_in_spring_security","title":"CSRF In Spring Security","text":"","tags":["Spring","SpringSecurity"]},{"location":"Spring%20Security/CSRF%20-%20Cross-Site%20Request%20Forgery/#disable_default_csrf_protection","title":"Disable Default CSRF Protection","text":"<ul> <li>By default, any web application or web framework will stop the communication if someone is using POST, PUT and DELETE Http methods which will potentially alter the data using causative issue.</li> <li>So, if you start your spring security application and try calling apis with POST, PUT and DELETE methods, you would see the error code 403 although you put the correct credentials for calling those apis.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>In case your spring boot application is running in the internal network behind firewalls and the outside hackers can not access your links.

The <code>HttpOnly: false</code> means that the FE side can use script to access and get the value of the cookie, if the <code>HttpOnly: true</code> the FE side can't use script to access and get value of the cookie, if the developer try to use script to get this cookie value, he will be received an empty string by default. However, the browser in some case, can still send the value of cookie to the server although the cookie with parameter <code>HttpOnly: true</code>. This is the reason why you can see the session cookie with <code>HttpOnly: true</code> but you still see it is appended in the request to server, this is the feature of the browser.</li> <li>Go back to the <code>CSRF token</code>, we have the  <code>HttpOnly: false</code> so it means the FE side have to use script to collect the <code>CSRF token</code> cookie and add it's value into request's header, this is not the session cookie so the browser will not do it automatically for you.</li> <li>Now, let's start your spring security application and call the post api again, you will received the status 200 and one more cookie with name <code>XSRF-TOKEN</code>, so it is the <code>CSRF token</code> cookie.</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringSecurity"]},{"location":"Spring%20Security/CSRF%20-%20Cross-Site%20Request%20Forgery/#see_also","title":"See Also","text":"<ul> <li>Cookie</li> <li>Session</li> <li>Web Browser</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringSecurity"]},{"location":"Spring%20Security/CSRF%20-%20Cross-Site%20Request%20Forgery/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>Spring Security Zero To Master</li> <li>Stackoverflow</li> <li>Full Source Code</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringSecurity"]},{"location":"Spring%20Security/Client%20Credentials%20Client%20Server/","title":"Client Credentials Client Server","text":"<ul> <li>In the Client Credentials Resource Server, we learned how to config Spring Boot Resource Server with Keycloak  authorization server for <code>Client Credentials Grant Type</code> using <code>Token Signature</code>\u00a0Resource Server and we used Postman as the a client to get access token and use it to call to the Spring Boot resource server manually.</li> <li>In this section, we will continue to configure a Spring Boot client server which will connect to Keycloak authorization server to get token and call to Resource server automatically when the user call to client server to get the data.</li> <li>If you haven't know about <code>Token Signature</code> Resource Server, you can view this post: OAUTH2 Resource Server Token Validation.</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringSecurity"]},{"location":"Spring%20Security/Client%20Credentials%20Client%20Server/#prepare","title":"Prepare","text":"<ul> <li>So firstly, we need to overview the simple diagram that we are going to do as in the image below.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>So as you can see, when the user use <code>Postman</code> to call to the Spring Boot Client application then it will automatically call to the Keycloak authorization server with the client credentials to get the access token and then call to the Spring Boot Resource Server application to get the data and return to the Postman.</li> <li>For setting up Keycloak authorization server please view Keycloak Setup with Client Credentials Grant Type.</li> <li>For setting up Spring Boot Resource server with Keycloak please view Client Credentials Resource Server.</li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringSecurity"]},{"location":"Spring%20Security/Client%20Credentials%20Client%20Server/#understand_oauth2_client_dependencies","title":"Understand OAuth2 Client Dependencies","text":"<ul> <li>Before going the implementation details, we should take a look through the core interfaces/classes of the <code>spring-security-oauth2-client</code> dependencies which we will use in the Spring Boot service to create Spring Boot client server with Keycloak.

The name <code>encode</code> means converting from one from to another form and thereby using encoding algorithms or encryption or hash. So which this method, classes that implement it should accept a raw password which is coming from the framework and they have to encode it as a part of requirement.</li> <li>The method <code>encode</code> will be called by Spring Security framework as soon as it receives a raw password from the use and it will try to generate a hash by taking the original raw password.</li> <li>Then we Spring Security framework got the hash password then it will leverages <code>matches</code> method. So the <code>matches</code> method is the place where our spring security first try to call the <code>encode</code> method by passing the <code>rawPassword</code> to get the hash value and at the same time, it also accept another parameter which is <code>encodedPassword</code> , which is already saved inside the database. So It will take both the has values and try to compare and return a boolean (true/false). Then based on this method, the framework will decide whether it should authenticate the user or not.</li> <li>Lastly, we have method <code>upgradeEncoding</code>, the purpose of this method is used to make your hashing algorithm or encoding or encryption algorithm to be more complex for the user to decode it. So if the return value is true, it means spring security will try to do encoding on the top of existing encoding. That means you will be doing that encoding, encryption or hashing two times, which give you more security.

Both methods <code>init()</code> and <code>destroy()</code> are on executed once, when a filter is initiating or destroyed.</p> </li> <li> <p>The method <code>doFilter()</code> is used for applying our business logic for the filter.

This method receives as parameters the <code>ServletRequest</code>, <code>ServletResponse</code> and <code>FilterChain</code>.</li> </ul> Parameters Descriptions <code>ServletRequest</code> It represents the HTTP request. We use the <code>ServletRequest</code> object to retrieve details about the request from the client <code>ServletResponse</code> It represents the HTTP response. We use the <code>ServletResponse</code> object to modify the response before sending it back to the client or further along the filter chain. <code>FilterChain</code> The filter chain represents a collection of filters with a defined order in which they act. We use the <code>FilterChain</code> object to forward the request to the next filter in the chain. <ul> <li>You can add a new filter to the spring security chain either before, after, or at the position of a know one.

Usually the user will prove his identity with the help of username and password. The Client The application that want to access the resources owned by the user on their behalf. The client uses a client id and secret to identify itself. But these not same as user credentials. The Authorization Server The server that authorizes the client to access the user resources in the resource server. When the authorization server identifies that a client is authorized to access a resource on behalf of the user, it issues a token. The client application uses this token to prove to the resource server that it was authorized by the authorization server. The resource server allows the client to access the resource it requested if it has a valid token after validating the same with Auth server. <ul> <li> <p>To understand easier, let's take a look on the example image above. Assume that we have a user who is the resource owner of some projects in his <code>GitHub Resource Server</code>. Then this user want to use a third party application which is the <code>SonarCloud</code> to analyze his projects for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities. In this scenario the <code>SonarCloud</code> is the <code>Client</code> application and It will ask the user to go to the <code>GitHub Authorization Server</code> to enter the credentials for proving his identity. Then if the identity is approved, the <code>GitHub Authorization Server</code> will issue a token to the user. So once the <code>Client</code> receives the token, this token will be send to the <code>GitHub Resource Server</code> to get the resources like his projects for scanning and analyzing. In this step, the <code>GitHub Resource Server</code> will validate the token issued by the <code>GitHub Authorization Server</code> is valid or not by connecting with the <code>GitHub Authorization Server</code>. It means everytime the <code>Client</code> send the token to the <code>GitHub Resource Server</code> so it will connect to <code>GitHub Authorization Server</code> to validate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Moreover, based on these 4 components we have 5 different grants and flows for applying OAuth2 to generate a token from Auth Server.

Then the <code>Spring Boot application</code> checks the credential and realize that, the user has not logged in yet then the it will save this API <code>URL</code> into a request cache, currently the request cache will be stored under a <code>JESSIONID</code> (<code>E6730EA2590274BC5EE3AC11472B29F2</code>) and it will be used in steps later. Then the user will be responded with a redirect URL <code>http://localhost:7070/oauth2/authorization/keycloak</code> to trigger authorization flow.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Now, The <code>Browser</code> calls the the responded API for triggering the authorization flow. When the API <code>/oauth2/authorization/keycloak</code> is called then the <code>Spring Boot application</code> will prepare an authorization redirect URL and it will also save the <code>OAuth2AuthorizationRequest</code> into a session (the <code>JESSIONID</code> - <code>E6730EA2590274BC5EE3AC11472B29F2</code> that we saw in the step above). Then the authorization redirect URL will be responded to the browser.

See the image below.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>So in the <code>step 1</code>, when someone calls app through browser or any app consumer with the credentials, a filter (authentication filter), which is present in the spring security framework, will be intercepting the request. </p> </li> <li> <p>Then it will try to convert whatever authentication details that we are receiving from the user like username and password into an <code>authentication object</code>. This authentication object is a base where all the validation of user credentials will validated. Once that ID object is built, the request will be passed to the <code>authentication manager</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Authentication manager</code> is the place where it will identify what is correspondent <code>authentication provider</code> that the request has to go. In this basic authentication example, we have not have many processes where we can validate user credentials or we may use database to validate user credentials or we may use LDAP or OAuth. So there can be many possible providers that your system has.</p> </li> <li> <p>In simple words, we can say that <code>Authentication manager</code> will identify what is the most appropriate <code>authentication provider</code> that the request has to be sent.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Authentication provider</code>, this is a place where all your business logic will be implemented. The logic related to your security like how do you validate username and password? There can be scenarios where you may receive email as a user. So based upon all such scenarios, you will implement all your logic of security validation inside your <code>authentication provider</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Authentication provider</code> will provide 2 interfaces. One is <code>user details services</code> and other one is <code>password encoder</code>. The <code>user detail services</code> is the interface which holds user schema and the <code>password encoder</code> which will tell you how all passwords have to be encrypted, encoded and decrypted while evaluating the security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once <code>authentication provider</code> using <code>user detail services</code> and <code>password encoders</code> validator with the input credentials are valid or not, the flow will be given back to the authentication manager followed by the <code>authentication filter</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now the authentication object, which we initially sent from the <code>authentication filter</code> will hold, whether the user is a valid authenticated user, what are the authorities or what are the roles associated with the user inside the authentication object.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once the <code>authentication filter</code> pass that <code>authentication object</code> to <code>security context</code> then all details will be <code>stored inside the container</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Security context</code> is the place where we save the data of the user once the users authenticated themself. It save details like whether the user is valid or might not be a valid user. </p> </li> <li> <p>All such details will be stored inside the <code>security context</code> and given back to the browser or any consumer from second time onwards. If they are trying to pass the same security information, all the flow from <code>step 1</code> to <code>step 8</code> will not be executed because we already tried to validate the person using that credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p>So, Spring Security will tell you, OK, using this token or these credentials whatever I am receiving from second time onwards,  I will directly show you whether this is the valid token or not. </p> </li> <li> <p>This is how it works internally in spring security framework.

In this method we will use <code>KeyGenerator</code> to generate 256 bits AES secret key.

Spring Boot provide an api java call <code>Cipher</code> to do encrypt and decrypt. So if we want to use AES, we have to getInstance Cipher for AES by using <code>Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING\")</code>, then init the cipher with 3 main params, Cipher Mode, SecretKeySpec and IvParameterSpec.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Cipher Mode</code>: Define the mode of Cipher that we want to use (Encrypt or Decrypt...)</p> </li> <li> <p><code>SecretKeySpec</code>: <code>SecretKey</code> is an interface and <code>SecretKeySpec</code> is an implementation of <code>SecretKey</code>. Every <code>SecretKey</code> has an associated algorithm name. So to make Cipher understands that which type of keys that you are using, so we need to create <code>SecretKeySpec</code> which contains our secret key and algorithm name.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>IvParameterSpec</code>: When using AES with a mode known as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), you need to generate an initialization vector (IV).</p> </li> <li>An initialization vector (IV) or starting variable is a block of bits that is used by several modes to randomize the encryption and hence to produce distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times, without the need for a slower re-keying process.</li> <li>In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. Each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point. To make each message unique, an initialization vector must be used in the first block.</li> <li>For CBC and CFB, reusing an IV leaks some information about the first block of plaintext, and about any common prefix shared by the two messages, so we need to generate IV randomly for every encoding.</li> <li> <p>More information</p> </li> <li> <p>So in method <code>encryptData</code> you can see we generate random IV every time this method is called, so it will make encrypted data will be different although we use the same input data for encryption. After the encryption has done we will add the IV key together with the encrypted data then the method <code>decryptData</code> will use this IV key for decryption.

Ideally, most of the applications they just wanted to validate whether the given user is present inside a database or LDAP application or inside memory of my spring security container. So in all that scenarios, we just pass username to this abstract method that we are receiving from the UI and this method we have in logic of fetching the <code>Userdetails</code> from the database or LDAP server or from the memory of the spring container.</li> <li>So <code>UserDetailsService</code> is an interface which have a logic of fetching the user from the database or any other places and the return type of <code>loadUserByusername</code> is <code>Userdetails</code>, because whenever we are dealing with users, we decided to use <code>Userdetails</code> schema adhering to the spring security.</li> <li>Then we have <code>UserDetailsManager</code> which will extend the <code>UserDetailsService</code> with abstract methods for user management like <code>createUser</code>, <code>updateUser</code>, <code>deleteUser</code>,  <code>changePassword</code> and <code>userExists</code>.</li> </ul> UserDetailsManager.java<pre><code>public interface UserDetailsManager extends UserDetailsService {\n\n    /**\n     * Create a new user with the supplied details.\n     */\n    void createUser(UserDetails user);\n\n    /**\n     * Update the specified user.\n     */\n    void updateUser(UserDetails user);\n\n    /**\n     * Remove the user with the given login name from the system.\n     */\n    void deleteUser(String username);\n\n    /**\n     * Modify the current user's password.

See Example: Configure Users With inMemoryAuthentication, Configure Users With inMemoryUserDetailsManager.</li> <li><code>JdbcUserDetailsManager</code>: this is the most famous implementation of spring security and this is a production grade of implementation That means if you provide data source details of MySQL or Oracle or any database, this <code>JdbcUserDetailsManager</code>  contain all the code related to loading the <code>UserDetails</code>, maintaining them, creating them, deleting them, changing passwords. </li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["Spring","SpringSecurity"]},{"location":"Spring%20Security/Understanding%20User%20Management%20interfaces%20and%20Classes/#inmemoryuserdetailsmanager","title":"InMemoryUserDetailsManager","text":"<ul> <li>If you check <code>InMemoryUserDetailsManager</code> you will see there is a property <code>users</code> which is a HashMap of <code>username</code> and <code>MutableUserDetails</code>.
